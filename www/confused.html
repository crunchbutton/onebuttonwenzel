		<h3>What is OneButtonWenzel.com?</h3>
		<font size=2>
		OneButtonWenzel.com sells the famous Wenzel sandwich made at Alpha Delta Pizza in
		New Haven Connecticut. It is a site built and run by Yale students and devoted
		Wenzel fans, and endorsed by the owners of Alpha Delta Pizza.

		<h3>What is a Wenzel?</h3>
		<font size=2>
		A Wenzel is a glorious sandwich - usually consisting of buffalo chicken, cheese,
		lettuce, tomato, and mayo on a toasty bun. However, you can buy a Wenzel anyway you
		like it - with ranch, blue cheese, bacon, extra sauce,
		eggplant instead of chicken, ... and the list goes on. <b>A standard Wenzel costs $8.75.</b>
		</font>
		
		<h3>What can I expect when getting Wenzeled?</h3>
		<font size=2>
		Upon clicking the 'Wenzel Me' button, an order will be placed with Alpha Delta,
		who will deliver you your Wenzel(s) in approximately half an hour. If paying with
		credit card, you must complete the checkout process before the order is placed. If
		you would like to pickup your order at Alpha Delta, just type 'pickup' in the delivery
		box. 
		<font>
		
		<h3>How can I ensure a smooth order process?</h3>
		<font size=2>
		If you need to cancel an order, please do Alpha Delta a favor and give them a call
		within a couple of minutes of placing the order - they will start making your sandwich
		right away so don't delay. Also, please enter your correct phone number. The delivery guy
		 needs to let you know when he arrives! Any orders with invalid phone numbers or 
		 addresses will be rejected.
